<p>3.Communication of the Source Code<br />The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as<br />Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with<br />each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to<br />the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to<br />distribute or communicate the Work.</p>
<p>4.Limitations on copyright<br />Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the<br />exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations<br />thereto.</p>
<p>5.Obligations of the Licensee<br />The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those<br />obligations are the following:</p>
<p>Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to<br />the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the<br />Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work<br />to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.</p>
<p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this<br />Distribution or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless<br />the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence &mdash; for example by communicating<br />&lsquo;EUPL v. 1.2 only&rsquo;. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the<br />Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.</p>
<p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both<br />the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done<br />under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, &lsquo;Compatible Licence&rsquo; refers to the licences listed<br />in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with<br />his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.</p>
<p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide<br />a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available<br />for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.<br />Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names<br />of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and<br />reproducing the content of the copyright notice.</p>
<p>6.Chain of Authorship<br />The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or<br />licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.<br />Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or<br />licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.<br />Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions<br />to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.</p>
<p>7.Disclaimer of Warranty<br />The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work<br />and may therefore contain defects or &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; inherent to this type of development.<br />For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an &lsquo;as is&rsquo; basis and without warranties of any kind<br />concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or<br />errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this<br />Licence.<br />This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.</p>
<p>8.Disclaimer of Liability<br />Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be<br />liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the<br />Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss<br />of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However,<br />the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.</p>
<p>9.Additional agreements<br />While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services<br />consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole<br />responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by<br />the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.</p>
<p>10.Acceptance of the Licence<br />The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon &lsquo;I agree&rsquo; placed under the bottom of a window<br />displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of<br />applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms<br />and conditions.<br />Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You<br />by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution<br />or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.</p>
<p>11.Information to the public<br />In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example,<br />by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website)<br />must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence<br />and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.</p>
<p>12.Termination of the Licence<br />The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms<br />of the Licence.<br />Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under<br />the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.</p>
<p>13.Miscellaneous<br />Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the<br />Work.<br />If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or<br />enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid<br />and enforceable.<br />The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence or updated versions of<br />the Appendix, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence.<br />New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.<br />All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take<br />advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.</p>
<p>14.Jurisdiction<br />Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,<br />&mdash; any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Union institutions,<br />bodies, offices or agencies, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice<br />of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,<br />&mdash; any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to<br />the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.</p>
<p>15.Applicable Law<br />Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,<br />&mdash; this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State where the Licensor has his seat,<br />resides or has his registered office,<br />&mdash; this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat, residence or registered office inside<br />a European Union Member State.</p>
